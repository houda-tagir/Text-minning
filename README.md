I need a complete technical report in French about my project: Detection of Fake Arabic News, using the models I applied.

📦 Dataset Details:
Dataset used: AFND (Arabic Fake News Dataset)

It contains 10,000 samples

Fields:

df['content'] includes the text + title

df['label'] includes 0 = not credible, 1 = credible

You can refer to the output of df.head() to understand the structure.

📁 Project Source:
I’ve provided a GitHub repository that contains everything related to my project:
https://github.com/houda-tagir/Text-minning/tree/main

It includes:

Source code (Jupyter notebook)

Results

Diagrams

My proposed report structure

An instruction file (Instruction.txt or similar)

✅ Objectives:
Please generate a complete technical report based on the content of:

The .ipynb file

The instruction file

The project structure

📊 Report Requirements:
The report must include:

A pipeline diagram

A process diagram

A flowchart (or any relevant UML/activity diagram)

Follow the structure I provided

Take inspiration from the architecture of the sample reports/articles I listed below

✍️ Language Style:
Use a simple and clear French writing style

Follow noun + verb + complement structure

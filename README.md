README or notes

‚úÖ Instructions for Report:
‚¨áÔ∏è Structure to Follow:
The report must include the following sections, in clear French, using a noun + verb + complement structure:

R√©sum√© (Abstract) ‚Äì ~1 page
Brief overview of the project, dataset, objective, models used, and main results.

Introduction
Introduce the problem of fake news in the Arabic world. Mention why it is important to detect fake news in Arabic specifically. Define fake news. Mention the role of NLP and machine learning.

√âtat de l‚Äôart (Related Work)
Briefly summarize existing approaches to fake news detection (especially in Arabic). Refer to the following articles and cite properly:

Enhancing Arabic Fake News Detection

AutoKeras for Fake News Identification in Arabic

Scientific Reports ‚Äì Arabic Fake News Detection

SSRN articles provided

Description du jeu de donn√©es (Dataset Description)
Describe the AFND dataset, its structure (title+text and binary label), language, and examples.

Pr√©traitement des donn√©es (Data Preprocessing)
Explain preprocessing steps used, including:

Tokenization

Normalization

Stopword removal

Stemming or lemmatization (if done)

Repr√©sentation des textes (Text Representation)
Mention the two approaches tried:

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
‚û§ Define and explain how it works.

ATC-TF-IDF (Augmented Term Frequency √ó Cosine normalization)
‚û§ Define this custom method and explain how it improves text representation (weighting terms better based on category).

Architecture du syst√®me (System Architecture)
Include:

A pipeline diagram (from raw data to results)

A flowchart (end-to-end steps)

A UML or activity diagram (to describe model training or system logic)

Mod√®les utilis√©s (Models Used)
Mention each model you used (e.g., SVM, Naive Bayes, CNN, LSTM, Bi-GRU, etc.)
Briefly describe each model (no math, just concept). Explain what you expected from each.

√âvaluation et r√©sultats (Evaluation and Results)
Compare the performance of the models using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Confusion Matrix
Present results in tables or charts, and clearly compare performance with TF-IDF vs. ATC-TF-IDF.

Discussion
Interpret the results. Which model performed best? Did ATC-TF-IDF improve the classification? What are the limitations?

Conclusion et perspectives
Summarize the key findings. Mention potential improvements (e.g., transformer models, better embeddings, data augmentation).

R√©f√©rences
Use the articles listed. Cite all sources properly in APA or another academic style.
Example:

Ameen et al. (2024) propose a framework to balance Arabic fake news datasets using oversampling. [source]

üìä Diagrams and Figures:
Include (you can extract or recreate from the GitHub repo):

‚úÖ Pipeline diagram (e.g., preprocessing ‚Üí feature extraction ‚Üí model training ‚Üí evaluation)

‚úÖ Flowchart of system logic

‚úÖ Process diagram for preprocessing or model selection

‚úÖ Comparison tables or bar charts for model performance

‚úçÔ∏è Language Style:
The report must be in French

Use simple grammar: noun + verb + complement

Avoid technical jargon where possible (or explain it briefly)

Avoid sounding like AI or GPT output

Make sure the tone is academic but easy to read

‚ö†Ô∏è Final Output Format:
Provide the final report as:

‚úÖ .pdf OR .docx OR .tex (LaTeX)

No source code in the report ‚Äì only explanations and analysis

All visual content must support the discussion
